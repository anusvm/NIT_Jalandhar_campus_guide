🧭 NIT Jalandhar Campus Guide
Navigating large college campuses can be a challenge—especially for new students, visitors, and even faculty members. 
Traditional solutions such as printed maps or verbal directions often fail to provide the efficiency and accuracy needed 
in today’s fast-paced educational environment. With the power of modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project introduces a dynamic and
interactive solution to transform how users explore and interact with the campus environment.
The Campus Guide is a web-based platform designed to help users quickly locate campus buildings, access key information,
get directions, explore events, and receive instant answers to frequently asked questions—all from a single interface. 
It offers real-time information access and user-friendly design, making it not just functional, but also intuitive for daily use.

🚀 Future Scope: We aim to integrate Artificial Intelligence for features like smart direction guidance and chatbot-based interaction, 
                 further evolving the project into a truly intelligent campus assistant.
